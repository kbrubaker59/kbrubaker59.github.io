It was ridiculous. My dad got teary-eyed in front of his new girlfriend. But at the last light after saying goodbye. It was an MGM. Hewlett's daughter. And sodden carpet. And I think she loved me too. I forgot her. The place went nuts. Now I'm treating water. At least the cops don't come in. All collapsed and futureless. It's such a sad sight cause of what we said. We went to Reno. And told myself I'm gonna be alright

For a little while. From El Caminos in the west. How many times. With closed eyelids. It was an MGM. We felt so sorry for him. Spare us the legal poems. We grabbed the lion. Broken legs can't run anyway. When I was a kid. I feel so far away from home. Doo doo doo. So there's my baby. I feel so far away from home. Always so far away

Laughing at me in the sun. (Ahh, oh). You can't rest at night inside your head. Hewlett's daughter. The Pacific will pacify us when we're done. The science halls. How many times have I sat right here and seen that skyline at twilight. And waste at nights. We saw a lion. It was an MGM. Always so far away. Loved her father. Have hollow walls. Wonder if I'm the weaker one. Just how

It was an MGM. Yeah at that last light after sayin'goodbye. If only we weren't always spun. High above the wrecks
