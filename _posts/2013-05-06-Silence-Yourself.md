I am here. Is it human to adore life?. I wouldn't make you feel so sad.. Always been. At the same time. I understand the urgency of life. If only I'd lived beyond regret,. This is easy. Is it bad. in the distance. don't let them wonder why you frown. That took me up. The strongest addiction I know. don't let the fuckers get you down. I adore life.

You are, you are. Or something stupid. You're never satisfied. The world is with me. The more you crave. don't let the fuckers get you down. A sad, sad person. Is it good. Was I feeling. Things we do. and starved a little bit more.. A sad, sad person. don't let the fuckers get you down. If only I'd hidden my lust. This is not hard

is it human to adore life. Is the same as the rush of cocaine. All alone. Since [?]. If I hadn't been so starved.. Is it a demon. I am shouldering you. Or an angel. And you're coming for the ride. I know evil when I see it, I know good and I just do it.. And there. When in love. If only I didn't want the world,. I'm sure my shame would be gone.. When in love

Is it love. Holding us. don't let them take away this song. I'm not gonna hurt you. Love is a disease. What happens in the brain. When in love. When in love. To your bedroom. If only I didn't ask for more.. Is it human to adore life?. I won't hide. Cause I'm flirting with you. I wouldn't feel guilt for what I take. Is it human ask for more?. Are you coming

I am here. When in love. Is it love. Is it human to adore life?. And question everything you do. It's not that bad. You just [?]. Or is it boredom. The more you have. Are you coming for the ride
