My baby's got a new man. I don't want to drink or score. Hey you!. Jumping jolly to the end, I wanna be your friend . And they're all running, red to green. And when the nights come in. I don't even like it here man. it keeps me upright. I'm walking home. You had a vulnerable heart and a smoking 42. He knows more than you do!. I don't want you to be my girl . I owe my honey. i am ashamed of what I've done. Out she ran too persistent, whoa, our mind is so absurd

I'm walking home. two bags of money. all day and night. Whoa love, whoa love . I want to talk to Tom!. And all the days come out. I'm walking home. Hey you!. There's nothing for me anymore. I wanna be your best friend, . And we're bound to get along!. I want to be alone!. Maybe I was to blame?. I don't want you to be my . You said I'd changed but I've always been this way

I don't want you to be my . I was standing under palm trees waiting for you. the way I've played. I wanna be your friend . I'm walking home. Every day. Shattered by the man and the pack of authority. You were the youngest Mary of three. Out she's later in the distance, shouting out a warn . i am ashamed of the way I've played. I don't want to come and play
