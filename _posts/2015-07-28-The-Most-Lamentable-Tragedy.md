Come on, come on, Siobh치n. From southern trees, you hang them in the air. He's free, unleashed. You're going through phases -. She doesn't know the kind of things I could do if I lose control. Waiting on a drugstore line. It's all true, isn't it?. If you're the poet you say you are and beauty's in everything you see. And the other relevant dudes. It's just a new set of clothes. On the same old selfishness. Enough weight to crush my face. Making my mouth complain. Don't shut the door. Until there was nothing left but for it to shrivel up and die

There's no real altruism, kid. And I hate to be awake. The world screams out in agony and you don't care. My portrait, proud and vain, hanging without a frame. The bed shakes until it breaks. And how dumb would you have to be. To do them again like I know you're going to?. Let me show you my fatal flaw. So I just lie and count the chains. Why do you do the things you've done. Is pounding the trouser snake. Someone I'd like to speak to after school. Come on, come on, Siobh치n. Waiting at the drugstore, oh yeah. I'm letting out the beast

I got what I came to find. Assign them a thousand names. Fragrance of a pungent skunk. Up to the top of the tenement. Follow me through the shadows of the stadium. Come on, Siobh치n. And filled it with hatred and rage. ome days start with an earthquake. I crossed an ocean for. Hung in the repugnant. But should the shit hit the fan. She's looking sad, the loneliest day that she ever had. Either from God or a guy with a gun. She's looking after me. She's walking down the street, she's looking cool

Waiting on the drug dealer all day. Because when there's suffering, you're there. Yeah, we're just two Catholic kids out on the run. Either way, these here boots. My family always saw me as the crazy one. Let me show you my fatal flaw. - cold piss!. Then how can love exist in a world run by people like you?. Let me show you my fatal flaw. You took a heart with so much room for love. A pair of eyes in which I could be more. Will she freak when she sees my capabilities?. Than fodder for the factory floor. Eric!. To praise their astounding strength

And I hate to be awake. Waiting on some drug deal all the time. Fuck you. Alleged elegant truths. The world is yours. Come on, come on, Siobh치n. Dungeon where I have sunk. I just pray you will not be spared. Both ways are about the same. Most days start with a dull ache. Out, walking the street. Are you some kind of man. On the wall of the house of pain
