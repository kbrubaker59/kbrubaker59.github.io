But you won't let those robots defeat me. Though i'm blind, it'll be all right. Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me. Do you realize. I think the state of mind that i'm in. You and me, we've lit our fuse. She's a black belt in karate. She has to discipline her body. That you have the most beautiful face?. That happiness makes you cry?. I know she can beat them. Yoshimi, they don't believe me. 'Cause she knows that it's demanding. I don't care if we're born to lose. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Infinity. But you won't let those robots eat me. we should drop it right now. What does it mean?. This man came up to me just the other day. That everyone you know someday will die?. He asked me if I'd been born again. Going to infinity. Do you realize. Going to infinity. Do you realize. I don't care if we're born to lose. Going to infinity. Her name is Yoshimi. Working for the city.

We're floating in space?. You and me, we've lit our fuse. well you've got yourself to blame. Do you realize. Out all night, sun's too bright. To defeat those evil machines.
