Underneath the casserole-. Sleepwalking. Dirty, dirty fingernails. Dirty, dirty fingernails. 'Cause I'm sleepwalking. Out of the shower,. I fell in love and I needed a road map. there was two days I 'fore I had to leave.. Dirty, dirty fingernails. I probably will not ever be

Point A To Point B oh I Know. Point A To Point B oh I know. I drove my car on June 14th. so I ate Minithins to stay awake.

Underneath the casserole. So lonely but never alone I know. Out of the shower,. lots of points with no points in between, for me. uh oh uh oh down low down low etc.

Dirty, dirty fingernails. Dirty, dirty fingernails. I am not who I want to be. I'm at my house but I wish that I were at home
