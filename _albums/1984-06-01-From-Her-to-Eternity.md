You entered the cathedral when you heard the solemn knell. I'm gonna clean up my house;. I was not sitting with the gargoyles. There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes. This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course. I was a-hiding all away. Do you love me?. On the screen there's a death, there's a rustle of cloth. Up those stone steps I climb. I was not there, dear. I was a-hiding all away. Well, he shot you full of Pethidine and then he went and billed you twice. For I am captured. Do you love me?. You searched for me all among the knowledgeable air

Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing. But right now, right now,. I look at the stone apostles. Straight to you. 'Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes. I was a-hidden, dear. The candle gutters on the ledge. I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses. You went looking for me, dear, down by the sea. I was hiding, dear. You asked an electrician if he'd seen me round his place. This is the time that I'll come running. I was not swinging from the bell. Sent sparks zapping out your face. I was a-hiding, dear

I was hiding, dear. Then you went to the museum and you climbed the spiral stair. Do you love me?. Hail the pentecostal morn. right now I am a-roaming.. You found some little silver fish but you didn't find me. One more time. Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit. The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled. Straight to you. He touched you with his fingers. I was hidden, dear. Do you love me?. I'm gonna talk it through;. There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth

I was a-hiding all away. I was a-hiding all away. When I get home,. But right now, right right now,. When I get home,. When I get home,. And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle. A-hiding all away. Onward and onward and onward I go. Who's holding my childhood to ransom. I was a-hiding all away. Into it's great shadowed vault I go. And it's all downhill with a bullet. When I get home,. I'm gonna put things in order...

I was a-hidden, babe. And a sickly voice calling me handsome. I'm gonna make that call;. Hail this joyful day's return. A-well, you went and asked the doctor to get some advice. I was hiding, dear. When I get home,. For I am captured. All right now. I was a-hiding all away. On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla. I'm gonna straighten it out.... This is the time of our great undoing. When I get home,. But I was a-hiding, dear
