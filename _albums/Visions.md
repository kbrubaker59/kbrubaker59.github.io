Oh it's on the roof. Oh, when I get up, this is what I see. You hate, you bite, you lose. Oh it's on the roof. Oh it's on the roof. There were moments when it seemed okay (But I go back alone). I won't take your breathe away. I won't take your breathe away. You claw, you fight, you lose. Taking all my time. And you're taking your time. I won't take your breathe away. Oh it's on the roof. Taking all my time. Going out as I closed our window

I don't see the light I saw in you before. And you can't say. If you don't need me. And you're taking your time. Oh it's on the roof. Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb. Where do you go? Oh, where do you stay? (I go back alone). And now I don't care anymore. I wanna peer over the edge and see in death if we are always the same. ohh I won't take your breathe away. And now I don't, and now I don't. Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane (oh, yeah). Oh it's on the roof. Hey, hey, hey. (And now I don't care anymore)

Oh it's on the roof. Oh it's on the roof. Welcome to reality. Baby, believe me. Oh it's on the roof. Just let me go. ohh I won't take your breathe away. Oh it's on the roof. (Uncontrollable). Oh it's on the roof. And you're taking your time. And you're taking your time. Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again. You'd destroy everything you love. "I love you" almost every day

When we were young, we used to get so close to it and you were scared and you were beautiful. Oh it's on the roof. And you can't say. Oh, when I get up, this is what I see. And you can't say. If you had every chance. Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb. Remember when we used to say. I saw a light in you. Got a doll that looks just like you. And you can't say. And you're taking your time. There was a time when the music would play (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh). And you're taking your time. You never liked me anyway
