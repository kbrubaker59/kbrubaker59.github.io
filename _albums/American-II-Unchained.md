you're the one that held my hand when i fell. Oh, nobody else can walk it for you, you got to walk it by yourself. A pickin' singin' folk group. Lord come now yeaaa. This musical aggregation toured the entire nation. Well, the one on the right was on the left. revalations the whole worlds going wild. when he comes. we've lived out all the stories. So heavy and apperceive I could scarcely breath. He rode easy in the saddle. ASkin God is he really coming back to get me. And folks just called him. And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet. I stumbled over a crumbling buck board

I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks. But a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong. He was tall and lean and at first you'd a thought nothing. Got my pistol, got my bottle, got my warface. And I want you to know. I seemed to be surrounded be a mystery. the world gonna pay. The Reverend Mr. Black, he was poor as a beggar. was harder and wilder back then. Its going to get crazy in the city. if i just couldn't make it alone. and harder to love than most men. The sand did not lie still. it takes one to know me. sang all the old songs

Come on, come on. (Spoken by Johnny Cash). not Faith Evans im talking bout the faith that places you in heaven. and if the church is the only place i feel safe. The bones of the cattle picked clean by buzzards. But he rode like a king. I gotta walk that lonesome valley, I got to walk it by myself. or playing with yeaa. Verse 1. While prospecting in a western state. And the one in the middle was on the right. And stopping to rest I heard a tinkling, whispering sound. And the one on the left was in the middle. Oh, nobody else can walk it for me, I got to walk it by myself. and the blood that ran in these tired hands

For weeks I wondered aimlessly in the valley. But political incompatibility led to their downfall. when i see the Lord i'ma bow down and shoot a bird at them devils cause its on. when he comes. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing. it's on now. You got to walk that lonesome valley, you got to walk it by yourself. Nearly covered by the sand. on that day,. They sang the mountain ballads. And the guy in the rear was a Methodist. He was a mountain of a man. maybe it's just that i've grown. no where to run. There once was a musical troupe

it's true that i used to be crazy. He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. But i got faith and i mean real faith. Singing the traditional ballads. Bleached by the desert sun. (chorus). And everything i ever learned as a child. Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind. And the folk songs of our land. They were long on musical ability. He carried a Bible in a canvas sack. Folks thought they would go far. But one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. and i don't feel as tall as i used to. I discovered the Valley of the Shifting, Whispering Sands
