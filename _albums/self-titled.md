Another nova on the way. my head my shoulders knees and toes. hey I've got a television it's filling me with home. and we move just like the birds, moving amidst the other birds,. Don't wear no suits, we're talking t-shirts. You look good in the east, all elbows and knees. I'm all stops and starts. But saying we, it's a reminder. The choices I make. don't you wanna get some. I'm all space and stars. Heeey Mama won't you come dooown. I've got a phone that beeps it makes me know I'm not alone. I've got a television it's filling me with home. I've got a phone that beeps it makes me know I'm not alone

wherever I end up wherever I roam. I've got a phone that beeps it makes me know i'm not alone. Gently dancing in my room. You look good in the west, see how you clap those hands. Though the constant is constant. all beyond. Will all fade to dust. The modern wolf, he's kinder. To the honey dipper, to the sound shifter. got a hurt. my head my shoulders knees and toes. To the river, To wait, To beeee. cry. Hey Mama won't you come down. Ahoo, Ahoo

my head my shoulders knees and toes. Been bending notes, just like his father. But oh you look like a morning star, to see who we are, oooooo. See how he lies, makes women shiver. We come to grips with our wrists, we come to sound with our mouth. While the metal's shifting. He ain't no dad, his voice is smoother. I've got a television it's filling me with home. Heeey Mama won't come down. I'm a brilliant machine. Through the light beam ark. and I know you're protecting the light of lichen. Dress. and I know I'm protecting the light of lichen. cry

You look good in the south, see how you use your mouth. It's not me you're talking to. they're running every way where to go. my head my shoulders knees and toes. my head my shoulders knees and toes. But oh you look like a morning star, just see who we are, oooooo. they take me to where I want to go. Hey, Mama won't you come down. esso. We sing of what we think we know, mother, father, skin and flaws. Composed of softer things. and we move just like the fish, rolling away from larger. wherever i end up i sleep like a stone. young. To the river, To wait, To beeee my head my shoulders knees and toes. Compression ache, scale bends and sways. I'm breaking up
