And he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls, oh yeah. O brother, my cup is empty. And there's a devil waiting outside your door. I hope it does as I have planned. Love Letter Love Letter. That I have held in my hand. Of your broken little hearts. Lift up your voice, lift up your voice. And V is for loving virtually all that you are. (How much longer?). Go get her Go get her. Brother, my cup is empty. For to buy no more whiskey. You don't even want to let them start. And it is bucking and braying and pawing at the floor

I have to go home. Loverman, since the world began. (How much longer?). Here, take these before we run away. There's a devil waiting outside your door. And he's shouting your name and he's asking for more. O brother, buy me one more drink. Here comes Frank and poor old Jim. (How much longer?). There's a devil waiting outside your door, oh yeah. Forgive us now for what we've done. We're older now, the light is dim. (How much longer?). R is for rape me and M is for murder me. Losing her again is more than I can bear

There's a devil waiting outside your door. O children. With a crooked smile and a heart-shaped face. I cannot blame it all on her. (How much longer?). I press my lips against her name. (How much longer?). I'll explain the nature of my pain. Her Spanish fly and her monkey gland. I am the captain of my pain. She's got a house-big heart where we all live. They're mopping up the butcher's floor. A plea, a petition, a kind of prayer. (How much longer?). For many a night I lay awake

E is for loving almost everything you do. O children. Children. Two hundred words. We live in hope. I kiss the cold, white envelope. Go tell her Go tell her. The trashing cane. They measure the room, they know the score. Take off that dress, I'm coming down. L is for love, baby. Rejoice, rejoice. It started out as a bit of fun. Comes from the West country where the birds sing bass. For to buy no more whiskey. (How much longer?)

I have to go home. Give him more, give him more. My dear, my darling one. And I haven't got a penny. They're gathering round with all my friends. They are knocking now upon your door. The whipping mane. I hold this letter in my hand. To blame her all would be a lie. Yes, let me tell you once again. He's weak with evil and broken by the world. And you are only just beginning. I'm your loverman 'cause I am what I am what I am what I am. Forever, Amen, yeah till end of time. The keys to the gulag
