All things move toward their end —. Where is Mona?. On that you can be sure. Where is Michael?. Where is John? They are all out back. Whispering low that I love her. The wind in the trees is whispering. I put my hand over her. A plea, a petition, a kind of prayer. I kiss the cold, white envelope. Where is Mary?. Under fifteen feet of pure white snow. Would you please put down that telephone. You wave and say good-bye. Hit it! Mmm...

Till I could not see. And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?. The boatman calls from the lake. Go tell her Go tell her. She was a sweet and happy thing;. Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy:. I kept waving my arms. And I swear that it is true. Is my enemy. You wave at the sky with wide lovely eyes. I hope it does as I have planned. But my neighbour. She puts her hand over mine. Step on the beach beneath the iron skies. Waves and waves of love good-bye

You wave and wave your wide lovely eyes. Down the tunnel that leads to the sea. Then one morning I woke to find her weeping and for many days to follow. She's long gone. “Farewell happy fields,. Down in the lime tree arbour. Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow and a dark and grim force set sail. She grew so sad and lonely;. I have no place to stay and my bones are cold right through. But all things move toward their end,. Your dress size with your wide lovely strides. My neighbour waved to me. Or what life had in store.... And we were married in the spring. Where joy forever dwells,

Where is Mathew. The sky hangs heavy with rain. I waved to my neighbour. I had no idea what happiness a little love could bring,. Became Joy in name only. Where is Mark?. Love Letter Love Letter. Crystal waves and waves of love. Was it an act of contrition, or some awful premonition?. She's taken her along. Hail, horrors, hail!”. Under fifteen feet of pure white snow. Love Letter Love Letter. As if she saw into of her final blood-soaked night;. Allow me to impose on you;

But they haven't put their mittens on. And through the garden with your secret key. I hold this letter in my hand. Have mercy on me, sir,. Two hundred words. We live in hope. Go get her Go get her. Her eyes were bright blue jewels. I will tell you a story of a man and his family,. A lone loon dives upon the water. Losing her again is more than I can bear. I press my lips against her name. Now it's getting dark?. Down in the lime tree arbour. We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow
