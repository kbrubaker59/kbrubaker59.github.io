She sits and waits. Silence grows. Stranger(?) Animals(?) Anger(?). It's for the future now. I've always loved you. I thought the world would cry. Lost in (?) every. My feelings flow. Words you wrote they only make me cry. Sugar lips. Where are your (?) now?. Lose those tears. In a corner

I thought the world would cry. Some velvet morning when I'm straight. Lose those tears. and how she gave me life. Words you wrote they only make me cry. It's for the future now. She sits and waits. Sugar lips. Dragonflies and daffodils. I'm gonna open up your gate. Some velvet morning when I'm straight. Where are your (?) now?. Stranger(?) Animals(?) Anger(?). And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra. Flowers growing on the hill

and how she made it in. Lost in (?) every. I've always loved you. In a corner and how she gave me life. Richard you slowly felt your fear.. Hey, I Saw The Sun and It moves. Richard how's life on your side?. Your life succumbs, sun is dry.. Hey, I Saw The Sun and It moves. And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra. In a corner. Some velvet morning when I'm straight. The silent life falls apart,. Your love and all start to melt.. Hey, I Saw The Sun. and how she made it in. I'm gonna open up your gate. Richard i fell on your lies,

Dragonflies and daffodils. Richard your soul's with my heart,. Under the moon now, you can tell by the night. She sits and waits. Some velvet morning when I'm straight. Flowers growing on the hill
