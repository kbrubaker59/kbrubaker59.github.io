Inside of me. The Messiah is my sister, ain't no king man, she's my queen. And the cars, they burn below me. Too much to take, come cross to bear. Love spreads her arms, waits there for the nails. There's method to my madness. And he knew what to do with it. In Harmony. And the cars they burn below me. One For All. It's a beautiful thing. She didn't scream, she didn't make a sound. If We All Join Hands We'll Make A Wall. Your final flight can't be delayed. Don't these times fill your eyes

Hammer flash in the lightning, they're hurting her again. All For One. And I say bye bye. One For All. Hear me. Got the horn good to go wait. Your pink fat lips let go a scream. Are you all alone?. So I stay so high. One For All. Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean. When the streets are cold and lonely. Everybody saw it, saw the dust that he made. The Mystery. King bee in a frenzy, ready to blow

Cold black skin, naked in the rain. Let me put you in the picture, let me show you what I mean. Yes, there's reason to my rhyme. I'm begging you, begging you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You fry and melt, I love the scene. Just lies to steal your mind. If We All Join Hands We'll Make A Wall. The fly on the coach wheel told me that he got it. No earth just sky, it's so serene. Here is a warning, the sky will divide. The last thing that your hands will feel. When the streets are cold and lonely. I'm begging you. It's a beautiful thing

All For One. I'm begging you, begging you. that I'm running out of time. I'm hiding in the trees with a picnic, she's over there, yeah. It's a beautiful thing. Now I know that you're thinking. Your knuckles whiten on the wheel. Oh, his stings all gone. Sister must have missed ya. If We All Join Hands We'll Make A Wall. Sometimes I fantasize. All Designed To Be. I forgive you boy, but don't leave town. I don't wanna steal your shine. All Eyes To see

I forgive you, boy, I will prevail. All For One. Now he's begging you, begging you. There was no crucifixion.
