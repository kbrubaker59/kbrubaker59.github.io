we should drop it right now. I don't care if we're born to lose. Her name is Yoshimi. well you've got yourself to blame. Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair. Working for the city. This man came up to me just the other day. But you won't let those robots defeat me. Though i'm blind, it'll be all right. Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair. All those bugs buzzin' â€˜round your head. And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites. She has to discipline her body. The buzz of love is busy buggin' you. What does it mean?

I know she can beat them. 'Cause she knows that it's demanding. But you won't let those robots eat me. Going to infinity. Going to infinity. Infinity. Oh Yoshimi, they don't believe me. To defeat those evil machines. Out all night, sun's too bright. He asked me if I'd been born again. And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights. I think the state of mind that i'm in. You and me, we've lit our fuse. Yoshimi, they don't believe me. I don't care if we're born to lose

Going to infinity. You and me, we've lit our fuse. She's a black belt in karate
