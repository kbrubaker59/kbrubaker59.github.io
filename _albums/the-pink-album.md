Sweet Clover (3x). Words are all on the page. I climbed mountain for chairs don't look down. Flew a snow white dove. Gray crusaders with tails mother made. Your's a halo. Watch it disappear into the sun. That I? Bring Pain? (maybe "Prevail"). Fingers Stain My Gold. We drag our fate around the razor wire. Under this bridge I lie down.. Overcome. Off of my hand. Pheurton.. So Beautiful My Dear

Off of my hand. The name is unknown to me. Turn me inside out this time. Disappeared. Overcome. Who Can Decide?. Disappear into the sun. Rain Song. I Can't See. In the shadows. Of course. In the shadows. And chained. This Thin Line Greased. Set In Stone To Split The Night

(Hmmmm...). We plan the great escape. Put A Word To These.. Flew the snow white dove. Lost and tired. Try this figure out. Of course. Sweet.... For dreams that sounded does. But our fear keeps us in line. And tears and blood. So Beautiful My Dear. I'm in need of. We're miles away from home. Put A Word To These.

In the shadows. Will I Decide?. Rain Song. And we're lost beneath the waves. Into the sun now I'm bleeding. Drives Me Crazy. Trip over words with gifts and garage.. In the shadows. See how they run catch butterfly.. Buried in me lies a child's toy. Looking back the place that I come from. In the shadows. How will they know just where to find?. Not a trace to mark the graves. We sink like stones

Turn my face. To the place where I go into the sun. Will to become their pride, why?
