Only you can do it. And I'll see to it. It did not know what it was. When the child was just a child. Maybe waiting tables in a diner. In some remote city down the highway. Keep me alive. Like a child it had no habits. After all that we've been through. If not, you'll die too. No opinion about anything. Get a job as a waitress. Maybe i will get a job

I make your life exciting. You and me are lovers. We both love each other. Buckle Up, Buckle Up, Buckle Up. You ain't going nowhere. Naturally or naturally. You make sure I'm crying. But sometimes we're high-fiving. some days better than others. We are usually a scream.
