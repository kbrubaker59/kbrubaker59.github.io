The bed shakes until it breaks. I just pray you will not be spared. If you thought I was down here alone. And the mighty of Earth will have no other recourse. And I hate to be awake. And say conclusively. He's just eighteen for now but he's going to murder us all. So I just lie and count the chains. Assign them a thousand names. And the worst of the three, you now have to expect. Because we have been told that if you've been assured. But should the shit hit the fan. Is there a boy in this town that's not exploding with hate?. Satan ain't hard to see without craning your neck. Tonight two great ships will pull back to their ports

Both ways are about the same. To do them again like I know you're going to?. If you're the poet you say you are and beauty's in everything you see. Enough weight to crush my face. And then our tragedy will be finally complete. Hung in the repugnant. And they were so strong. But to shiver and shake and make shit in their shorts. No one cares what I've got to say anymore. Innovation, I leave to smarter men. Throw my guitar down on the floor. Until there was nothing left but for it to shrivel up and die. No one throws it away like they do. Without winking?. Most days start with a dull ache

Prepare to be told "That shit's gay, dude". Is pounding the trouser snake. That made your every dream a screaming scene. Then how can love exist in a world run by people like you?. I just lost track of time. And in the morning the shells will wash up on the shore. Yes, I protected you. I'll write my masterpiece some other day. But expect no apologies. And yes, you got me wrong. Well, I guess that what they say is true. It's been long gone. Fuck you. From southern trees, you hang them in the air. The things I used to hate, I have learned to accept

I didn't come here to be damned with faint praise. He's a remote explosive waiting for someone to call. You took a heart with so much room for love. And they got greener eyes. Why do you do the things you've done. And I hate to be awake. And filled it with hatred and rage. But the name of the crime. Depleted of everything that shoots flames and reports. "Yeah, the beast was me.". To praise their astounding strength. I just been done down in this dungeon so long. Is there a human alive that can look themselves in the face. Dungeon where I have sunk. And larger needs

Pretty melodies don't fall out of the air for me. Making my mouth complain. No, I got this family, they're bigger and meaner than me. My portrait, proud and vain, hanging without a frame. There's a way to live the values your forefathers gave you. Is there a girl at this college who hasn't been raped?. That there is no race more human. And how dumb would you have to be. You best believe. Because when there's suffering, you're there. Only remember I did something wrong. Now that which you can see. Solidarity's going to give a lot less than it'll take. The things I used to love, I have come to reject. On the wall of the house of pain
