Please could you stop the noise?. Your shimmers or spells. Born of a light. I'm trying to get some rest. And fade out again. So let me go upon my way. In my spirit white. Which is of no consequence at all. Totally alive. Self defense. Voices in my head. (I may be paranoid, but not an android). It holds us like a phantom. With your opinion. Like a weapon

See the moon smiling. The touch is like a breeze. You will be first against the wall. Don't get heavy. It shines its understanding. What's there?. Ready to receive. Through an open doorway. It's like a weapon. From all the unborn chicken. And we're not at the mercy. All these things we'll one day swallow whole. When I am king. Against the present. Present tense

Keep it light and. This dance. Open on all channels. And fade out. What's there?. (I may be paranoid, but not an android). Of your shimmers or spells. Against the present. This machine will, will not communicate. Born of a light. The wind rushing round my open heart. I can feel their blue hands touching me. Rows of houses all bearing down on me. All these things into position. Keep it moving

Of self defense. This dance. I won't get heavy. An open ravine. (I may be paranoid, but no android). What's there?. In my spirit light. Now as I go upon my way
