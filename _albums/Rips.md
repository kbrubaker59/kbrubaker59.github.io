Can't stop thinking, so what do I do. I used to cry, cry, cry. Now you're out creepin' around. If you listen close you might hear the sound. Well, you keep telling me it won't be long. Turn around and you're gone. You're not gonna bring me down. Never needed no one. Radio on. That's when I found out I was wrong. Just looking for some action, trying to get down. Well, I would never let you down. Did you come out of the past?. You tell me this. Maybe I've changed but I don't worry

You never needed nothing. You're at the after-party every night. I just never want to hear that sound. Just about the time, time I get off. Can't stop feeling, so what do I do. If you gonna start messing around. Radio on. Wasted in the fog trying to see the light. Come on, baby, come on, give me a little reaction. You're gonna get it back. But you keep on saying that you're my friend I don't mind. You're so independent. I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOUR LOVE. You better hurry up, DON'T LET ME DOWN. Was it my imagination?

Never wanted to have fun. I thought you were a man of action. It's in my head, it's just a question of. I always knew you were strange from the start. But I didn't want to ask. Now I don't remember why. One more time, yeah do it again. It's what you give. You tell me that. Last night tore you apart. You had horses behind you. Last night you fell apart. You're gonna roll right past with the radio on I don't mind
