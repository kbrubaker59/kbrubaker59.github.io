Gamblin on instincts well here&rsquo;s what I found. This is my description of an ugliness.. And the way I feel. But the ones who move in this house are gonna go boony. He can&rsquo;t sing for shit.. black motorcycles and the will to survive. I&rsquo;m trying to be a person,. I&rsquo;m l.o.s.t. lost. C&rsquo;mon! Yeah! hey! all right. Monsters live on tv never in the zoo. You got an ugly ass guy,. They gotta get out but they don&rsquo;t know how. And life doesn&rsquo;t have to be rough. You got a song with no soul,. Fucking don&rsquo;t mean a thing.

is it the same under the sky?. And the way I feel. And I&rsquo;m trying to be a person,. But they all say I&rsquo;m worthless.. With a psychotic breakdown cardboard sign. in this glass and wire world. The profit of doom is walking the beach. In a garden of evil. Tells me my bucks ain&rsquo;t enough. But they all make me nervous.. The whole human race is already pretty loony. This is my description of an ugliness.. Means my heart is saved. He got a girlfriend on T.V,. I&rsquo;m l.o.s.t. lost

winners and losers in love with themselves. Ugliness. This is my description of an ugliness.. questions and questions plain as your nose. Tells me what I crave. With basketball tit&rsquo;s.. But a little white cloud. In a garden of evil. Their spaceship broke and they fell into this place. And the babes are babes. but who would believe a little rose?. losers and winners low and high. Ugly. And the money goes &rsquo;round. Voice from my pocket starts pulling me down

In a garden of evil. That girl&rsquo;s something,. I got my work. He got an ugly bouzy house,. Everything&rsquo;s faked and there&rsquo;s nothing to teach,. Ugliness. to send their message screaming. And i&rsquo;m l.o.s.t. lost. no santa claus no happy elves. Uglyyyy!. Ahhhhhhhooooooooooooo. Hang around with us and you&rsquo;ll be a monster too. one that has no meaning. Five little monsters were riding through space. surely leeches gain the right

You got a dog face chic,. I&rsquo;m l.o.s.t. lost. Pop. So they&rsquo;re waiting and waiting in a creepy creepy house. In a garden of evil. This is my description of an ugliness.. to people who feel. And there&rsquo;s no point in running crying. Ugliness. He got a problem with his dick.. I got my work. Winners and losers which one am I.
