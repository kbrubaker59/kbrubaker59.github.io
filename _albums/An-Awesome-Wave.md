Very yellow white flash. Triangles are my favourite shape. Something without warning, love. That eighteen steps is one complete set,. When I wake up in the morning light. By the law that she herself has set.. To photo, to record meat lumps and war. By the law that she herself has set.. That eighteen steps is one complete set,. And all your friends come sniffing.. Painless with immense distance. Bite chunks out of me. A violent wrench grips mass, rips light, tears limbs like rags. Then I look at you. Indochina, Capa jumps Jeep, two feet creep up the road

Eighteen teen strides and she stops to abide. Eighteen teen strides and she stops to abide. Three points where two lines meet.. Sunlight hurts my eyes. Walks to to count count her steps,. On the night line. Plays heavy on my mind. Then I look at you. She looks up up at the blueeeeeee,. And before the next nine right and nine left.. Burst so high finally Capa lands. And before the next nine right and nine left.. Then I look at you. She she she she only ever ver ver ver ver,. Toe to toe, back to back, let's go.

Then I look at you. Walks to to count count her steps,. On the night line. She she she she only ever ver ver ver ver,. They advance as does his chance,. She looks up up at the blueeeeeee,. My love it's very late.. You're a shark and I'm swimming. Ohh ohh. Mine is a watery pit. From medic from colleague, friend, enemy, foe. 'Til morning comes, let's tessellate.. My heart still thumps as I bleed.
