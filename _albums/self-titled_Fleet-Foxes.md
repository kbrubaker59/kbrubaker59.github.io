The world is alive now, in and outside I know. The borrower's debt is the only regret of my youth. Oh man what I used to be. Where did they go?. They do not know you anymore. Oh man oh my oh me. Woah. Oh man what I used to be. Such a selfless and true love. More, more, more. Woah, woah. To banner fair. Settle down with me by the fire of my yearning. Oh man oh my oh me. Than my mother and father

Where the birds wait and the tall grasses wave. Just to be at Innisfree again. I have borrowed all my lonesome life. You should come back home, back on your own now. Everything I took got soon returned. To follow you softly in the cold mountain air. The spring is upon us, follow my only song. If to borrow is to take and not return. When they had their daughter. And believe me it's not easy when I look back. Just lookin out for me. Could I wash my hands of?. Through the forest down to your grave. Come down from the mountain, you have been gone too long. Wanderers, this morning came by

Graceful in the morning light. And I can't, no I can't get through. Oh how could I dream of. So now I am older. Now what does that say about me.
